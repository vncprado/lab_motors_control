# Open Bionics - FingerLib.h

## Description
This library can be used to control up to 6 fingers, which allows control for an Open Bionics robotic hand (Ada, Brunel). Each finger is actuated using a Firgelli/Actuonix
linear actuator, where the position is determined by using the embedded linear potentiometer. 

FingerLib.h has been designed to closely resemble the Servo.h library, to allow ease of implementation for hobbyists and researchers.
